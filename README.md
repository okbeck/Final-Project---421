# Final Project
SWENG 421 Final Project

A quiz game application that utilizes builder, composition, dyanmic linkage, state, and read/write lock design patterns. The quiz game should allow users to dynamically load quizzes from a .csv file that then populates the current quiz for the user to take. The read/write lock is to ensure that no quiz is taken while being edit/created and vice-versa. The state pattern is responsible for handling the GUI and the different placements of elements. The composition and builder patterns are used to make up and create questions for the quizzes.
